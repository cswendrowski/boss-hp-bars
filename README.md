**Souls-Like Boss HP Bars**
=======

Module for FoundryVTT that adds Dark Souls-like HP bars for bosses and other tokens.
![Demo](.github/readme/demo.gif)

Currently indev.

**Usage**
-----------

Until a UI is implemented, you can use the macros found in *compendium/macros/Souls-Like Boss HP Bars*. There you can find the *Enable Boss Bar on Token* and *Disable Boss Bar on Token* macros. Drop those from the compendium, into your macros hotbar (bottom of the screen), then click on a token and use the Enable macro. You should see a boss far representing the token's Bar 1 (usually HP).

**Upcoming features/to-do**
-----------

* An actual UI instead of using macros.
* Per-token settings for animation timing, disabling animations, color, visibility etc.
* Whatever comes to mind later


*But what about this is even souls-like?* Good point. Add a stamina meter to your games and that should give you the full experience.

**Version history**
-----------

**0.1.0**
* First release. No UI yet, or per-token config settings.
